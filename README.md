# Ebay Scraper

## What is Ebay Scraper?
Ebay scraper is a tool that will let the user search a item on ebay and return an list of the sold products. The returned data includes: Tile, Sold Price, Bids, and Link to the product page. After retrieving the data it is stored into a csv file named 'results.csv'. 

## How do I use it?
When you run the script it will prompt you to enter a term you would like to search on ebay and after that the application takes care of the rest.

## What's the Purpose of this application?
It is a tool that let's a person get quick data on how much an item was sold for. Since the data is saved in a csv file it also allows the user to use technologies like Pandas do do further data analysis (a feature that will be added to the program in a future update)
